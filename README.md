The following class project utilizes regression methods for weather prediction and validation for the Champaign-Urbana region from 2010-2019.
Multiple linear regression using past Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast data was used to predict a WxChallenge-like forecast. This was also repeated using a ramdon forest regression analysis as well.

The weather predictions for this model used the following:
Using the 12 UTC GFS forecast and observations up to 00 UTC to predict the following variables for the 6 UTC to 6 UTC period of the following day:

Maximum Temperature (°C)
Minimum Temperature (°C)
Maximum Wind Speed (m/s)
Total Precipitation accumulation (mm)

The training data for the model were the years of 2010-2018 and 2019 was the validation dataset.
The following datasets were used in this project:

Hourly and Daily observations from KCMI that were used for both training and validation.
Daily GFS 12 UTC initialization forecasts, three hourly GFS durface forecast parameters, three hourly upper air forecast parameters.

A large portion of this project included data manipuliation. NAN values and missing data were removed from the observed data as well as the GFS model data. The individual datasets were then organized into pandas dataframes and merged into master dataframes.
